                Hi, <br> <br>
                I have you signed up for this weekend to make bouquet deliveries! If you have any last minute
                changes, please text me at 805-689-6431. Also, if you need to pick up late, lmk and I'll leave
                your stash in the stairwell!
                <br>
                We will not be offended if you double count the bouquets, cards and treats! We are
                human and have been known to make mistakes. If you are missing anything, best to know
                before you leave flower empower ðŸ™‚
                Thank you for your help!
