      Hi,
      
      I have you signed up for this weekend to make bouquets. If you have any last minute changes, please text me at 
      805-689-6431 to let me know. THANK YOU as always! Looking forward to seeing you.
         
      Here are a few reminders and the FE volunteer video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytF7e8YuUyo) in case you need a refresher:
      
      1. Table Sharing: Each table is designed for 2-3 people to work together. Sometimes we may have fewer volunteers,
       and a table might have just one person. Let's take this as an opportunity to connect and meet someone new!
      
      2. Priority for Recipients: Remember, our primary focus is on the recipients. Please ensure that they receive their 
      flowers first, before volunteers take any extras.
      
      3. Sharing Flowers: If someone comes to your table asking for flowers, please consider sharing. Requests usually 
      mean someone is in need of something to spruce up a bouquet, and your kindness can make a big difference.

      4. Stay to Clean Up: We appreciate everyone's help in cleaning up after the event. If you're unable to stay until 
      the end, please let us know in advance so we can plan accordingly for a swift cleanup.
      
      Thank you all for your ongoing support and dedication to Flower Empower Saturdays. Together, we're making a meaningful 
      impact in our community!
      
      Best regards ðŸŒ¸`,
      subject: "See you Saturday for Bouquets!ðŸŒ¸",
